## Mostly Texas Red Chili

Adapted from J. Kenji López-Alt [Real Texas Chile Con Carne](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2011/11/real-texas-chili-con-carne.html)


##### Ingredients:

  * 2 whole sweet fresh dried chilies like Costeño, New Mexico, or Choricero, stems and seeds removed
  * 1 small hot dried chilies like Arbol or Cascabel, stems and seeds removed
  * 1 whole Chipotle dried chilies canned in adobo sauce, plus 2 tablespoons sauce, stems and seeds removed
  * 2 whole rich fruity dried chilies like Ancho, Mulatto, Negro, or Pasilla, stems and seeds removed
  * 1 quarts low sodium canned or homemade chicken broth
  * 2 pounds beef chuck, trimmed of excess gristle and fat, cut into thick steaks
  * Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
  * 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
  * 1 medium onion, finely diced
  * 2 medium cloves garlic, grated on a microplane grater
  * 1/4 teaspoon powdered cinnamon
  * 1/2 tablespoon ground cumin
  * pinch teaspoon ground allspice
  * 1 teaspoon dried oregano
  * 1 tablespoons Asian fish sauce
  * 1 to 2 tablespoons masa
  * 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
  * 1 can Dark Red Kidney Beans

##### Directions:

  1. Add dried chiles to large heavy-bottomed Dutch oven or stock pot and cook over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until slightly darkened with intense, roasted aroma, 2 to 5 minutes. Do not allow to smoke. Remove chiles to small bowl and set aside. Transfer to a 2-quart microwave-safe liquid measuring cup or bowl. Add chicken broth and chipotle chilies, cover with plastic wrap, and microwave on high power until gently simmering, about 5 minutes. Remove from microwave and set aside for 5 minutes. Transfer chilies and liquid to blender and blend, starting on the lowest possible setting and gradually increasing speed to high (make sure to hold the lid down with a clean kitchen towel or a potholder to prevent it from blowing out). Blend until smooth, about 1 minute.

  2. Season chuck steaks generously with salt and pepper. Heat oil in the base of a Dutch oven over high heat until just starting to smoke. Add half of beef chuck in a single layer and cook without moving until deeply browned, about 6 minutes. Flip steaks and brown second side, 3 to 4 minutes longer. Transfer steaks to a cutting board. When cool enough to handle, cut seared steaks and raw steaks into 1 1/2- to 2-inch chunks.

  3. Return Dutch oven to heat. Add onions and cook, stirring frequently until translucent and softened, about 2 minutes. Add garlic, cinnamon, cumin, allspice, and oregano, and cook, stirring constantly until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add all meat back to pan along with chili puree and remaining quart chicken broth. Stir to combine.

  4. Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce to a simmer, cover, cook in a 200° to 250°F oven with the lid of the Dutch oven slightly ajar.

  5. Stir in kidney beans, fish sauce, masa harina (if using), and vinegar. Add hot sauce to taste. Season to taste with salt. For best results, allow chili to cool and store in the refrigerator at least overnight and up to five days. Reheat the next day to serve.

  6. Serve, garnished with hot sauce, cilantro, chopped onions, scallions, grated cheese, avocado, and warm tortillas as desired.
