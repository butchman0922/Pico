My Great Tasting Homemade Chicken Jerky For Dogs…

What You Need:

    3lbs Boneless, Skinless Chicken Breast
    Meat Slicer and Sharp Fillet Knife (Meat Slicer Is Optional)
    Oven or Dehydrator

Step 1. Wash the chicken thoroughly and then remove all traces of fat with the knife. Pat them dry.

Step 2. Place pieces of chicken on a plate or cutting board and put them in the freezer for about 1 hour. Prepare your cutting station during this time.

Step 3. If you’re using an oven, remove the racks, turn it on and set it to the 160 degrees (or the lowest possible setting). If you’re using a dehydrator (which is recommended), then you don’t have to prepare anything.

Step 4. Remove chicken from freezer. Chicken should be hard but not frozen solid. This makes it much easier to work with.

Step 5 (No Meat Slicer). If you don’t have a meat slicer at home, first I recommened that you get one. Makes things so much easier and you can slice everything from ham to chicken to pork to beef to veggies. Costs about $60 for a home slicer. Anyways…

Take your fillet knife and slice the chicken breast from top to bottom. Each slice should be about 3/8 or 1/4 of an inch in thickness.

Step 5 (Meat Slicer). Place the chicken breast on the slicer with the top of the breast toward the blade. Set the blade to about 3/8 of an inch. Turn on and start slicing. All of the slices will be uniform which makes for much easier dehydrating.

Step 6 (Using Oven). Place the chicken fillets on the racks. Place them as close to each other as possible without touching. Slide them in the oven. Close the oven most of the way. Leave open about 2 inches (use balled up aluminum foil to accomplish this). Should take anywhere from 4 to 8 hours to finish — depending on your oven. Flip chicken fillets halfway through.

Step 6 (Using Food Dehydrator). Place the chicken fillets on the food dehydrator racks. Turn it on and set it to 160 degrees. Set a timer for 3 hours and walk away. Check back when the buzzer goes off.

Step 7. Make a Decision

Do you want hard jerky or soft jerky? My dogs enjoy the softer type of jerky so I take out the chicken when it’s still pliable — not rock hard. It doesn’t last as long on the counter, but my dogs really love it. They eat the hard stuff, but they don’t go after it with the same type of “animal” hunger like they do the soft homemade chicken jerky dog treats.

If you want the hard stuff, just keep it in there for longer. If you want the softer homemade chicken jerky for dogs, keep checking on it until it’s done.
