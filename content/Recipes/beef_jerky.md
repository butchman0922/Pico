## Beef Jerky

Thanks to [Doc the WV Gourmet](http://allrecipes.com/cook/10340675/)

##### Ingredients:

  * 2 pounds beef round steak, cut into thin strips **
  * 1/4 cup soy sauce
  * 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
  * 2 tablespoons brown sugar
  * 2 teaspoons salt
  * 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
  * 1 teaspoon meat tenderizer
  * 1 teaspoon garlic powder
  * 1 teaspoon onion powder
  * 1 teaspoon paprika

##### Directions:

Mix soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, brown sugar, salt, pepper, meat tenderizer, garlic powder, onion powder, and paprika in a large bowl

Place beef strips in bowl. Mix to assure all the meat is evenly coated. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for 8 hours or overnight.
    
Arrange the meat strips on the tray of a dehydrator and dry at your dehydrator's highest setting until done to your liking, at least 4 hours.

Store in an airtight container or resealable bags.

** Place meat in the freezer for 30 minutes before cutting. Slightly frozen meat will be easier to cut into thin, consistent slices.
