-- standard method --
edit /etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf
make sure line is included
destination console_all { file("/dev/tty12"); };
uncomment last line or add
log {source(src); destination(console_all); };

Add the following line to /etc/innitab
c12:123456:respawn:/sbin/agetty -8 -s 38400 tty12 linux

-- for colored output --
Install ccze

To quickly test it, try tail -f var/log/messages | ccze -A

The -A switch prevents ccze from starting itself in a curses window.

Create a file cclm.sh in /usr/local/bin(you have to be root to be able to do so), with the following contents:
#!/bin/bash
file "/var/log/everything.log"
tail -f $file | ccze -A

# chmod 0700 /usr/local/bin/cclm.sh

Add the following line to /etc/inittab
c12:123456:respawn:/sbin/agetty -n -l /usr/local/bin/cclm.sh 38400 tty12 linux

Reboot to get it working.
