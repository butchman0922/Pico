-- fix polkit so we can use udisks as a normal user --

In unusual cases, you may need to explicitly setup PolicyKit to allow members of 
the storage group to mount and unmount with udisks (usually this is already the case). 
To do so, create a text file named /etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/10-udisks.pkla 
with this content:

[udisks]
Identity=unix-group:storage
Action=org.freedesktop.udisks.drive-eject;org.freedesktop.udisks.filesystem-mount
ResultAny=yes

Then add your user to the storage group if necessary (replace “myusername” with yours):

sudo usermod -aG storage myusername

reboot
