## GPS Datalogger
Microcontroller based GPS Datalogger

#### Introduction

        A simple microcontroller based GPS Datalogger for backpacking.

#### Inspiration

        Most of the wilderness areas that I backpack in have poorly marked trails.
    Therefore I do a lot of navigation with map and compass. Using that method
    usually gets me to where I want to go, however, in the past I have had no way of
    knowing what my actual route was and how close I stayed to my intended route. 
    With a GPS Datalogger I hope to be able to walk the my route using a map and
    compass and at the completion of the route download the GPS data and evaluate
    it using GIS mapping software such as Google Earth, Viking or Open Street Maps.  

### High Level Design

#### Design Considerations

    * Simple to use - set and forget
    * Waterproof
    * Long lasting or rechargeable power supply
    * Function in dense forest



#### Relevant Standards
